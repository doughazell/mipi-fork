==========
To-Do List
==========

Modularise
----------

Break the application into:

- Base Data Management Module,

with add-ons:

- Personal Data Sample
- Utility Asset Management
- Customer MDM

These add-ons are gems but will derive from the DataElement table the new
structures for particular scenarios. They will also have a set of views
that will display the data and a set of data to populate these
DataElement-derived views.


Security
--------

- Security is not implemented when directly accessing the DataElement such as 
  when viewing the XML code for an entity.
-

New Model
---------
- Add new type through interface.
 - New Type Name;
 - Mulitple Fields/Columns of various types.
 - TABLE META DATA, e.g.
  - Name,
  - Derived From,
  - Columns & Types
  - Defaults
  - Others...
  - DEFAULT_PAGE_LIMIT
  - DEFAULT_VARIABLE_NAME
 
DataElement
-----------

- [BUG] Update Data Element doesn't work
- Allow a "New [Data Element]" to be created through the 'Preview' interface, a chosen
  data sheet.

Globe
-----

- Derived Globe Types: Person, Company, House, Household, etc.
-

Profiles
--------

- Ability to dynamically add profiles to the globe through the main interface.

Components
----------

- Time Slider. Take earliest and current dates, place on a slide and allow
  users to be able to view data in the past.
  (a) Global Time Slider
  (b) Local Time Slider

 - e.g.: http://www.highcharts.com/demo/scatter
- DataTable
- will_paginate with array instead of RecordSets.

<%= sortable_element("preview_profiles", :url => sort_globe_profiles_path(@globe), :tag => "span", :handle => "handle", :overlap => :vertical) %>
...no longer works.

Sample Data Loading
-------------------
Paraterise the Rake commands for batch processing.

Read a database schema and generate DataElement structure to match. This should be
an import wizard we a set of clear steps. This needs to be graphical.

Data Element Import Wizard
--------------------------
- Graphical
- Import from MSSSQL/Oracle schema
- Choose tables/view to import
- Read structure.
- Propose column names
- Build migrations, action migrations.

In reality that provides us with classes like:
* CounterpartyDataElement
* LegalEntityDataElement
* CountryDataElement

WHY NOT JUST PUT A BI TOOL ONTO IT?
Because we want to write as well as read.
Therefore, don't pull off of the Data Warehouse
There is a repository of rules and mappings that need to be managed.

e.g. For PRA:
  ...convert REPO to Repo.
  ...format as dd/mm/yyyy
  ...truncate to 50 characters
  ...
