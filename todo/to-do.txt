To-Do List
==========

Modularise
----------

Break the application into:

- Base Data Management Module,

with add-ons:

- Personal Data Sample
- Utility Asset Management
- Customer MDM

These add-ons are gems but will derive from the DataElement table the new
structures for particular scenarios. They will also have a set of views
that will display the data and a set of data to populate these
DataElement-derived views.


Security
--------

- Security is not implemented when directly accessing the DataElement such as 
  when viewing the XML code for an entity.
-

New Model
---------
- Add new type through interface.
 - New Type Name;
 - Mulitple Fields/Columns of various types.
 - TABLE META DATA, e.g.
  - Name,
  - Derived From,
  - Columns & Types
  - Defaults
  - Others...
  - DEFAULT_PAGE_LIMIT
  - DEFAULT_VARIABLE_NAME
